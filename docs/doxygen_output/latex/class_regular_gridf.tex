\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines a regular grid in 2 or 3 dimensions. 

This class defines a regular grid in 2 or 3 dimensions. Each coordinate direction is divided into Nx, Ny, or Nz segments, whose lengths are given by dx, dy, or dz. This yields a total of Nx$\ast$\+Ny$\ast$\+Nz cells in the grid and (Nx+1)$\ast$(Ny+1)$\ast$(Nz+1) nodes.

For linear indexing, it assumes the x index varies faster than the y index and the y index varies faster than the z index. For example, the linear index of cell (i,j,k) is i + j$\ast$\+Nx + k$\ast$\+Nx$\ast$\+Ny.
